## Note
`Steam Workshop Downloader` will most likely fail to download anything from the last 2 years, aka anything recent, that is because steam changed how workshop downloads work, and you now need an account with the game in order to download from it.
That means that if the script fails to download smth, that is a known issue, and won't be fixed.
